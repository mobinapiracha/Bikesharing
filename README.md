## Overview 
In this analysis, we look at the feasibility of opening up a bikesharing business in Des Moines, Iowa. In order to present this idea to an Angel Investor for seed funding, we need to understand how the bike sharing businesses work in other cities such as New York City where CitiBike operates, from where we can understand how such a business can work in Des Moines. Therefore, we will explore the New York CitiBike data to look for insights in understanding how to make a bikesharing business a success in Des Moines.
